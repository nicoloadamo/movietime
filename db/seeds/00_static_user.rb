When I'm not busy coding, you can usually find me either at the movie theater or in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes.
I believe that both film and food have the power to bring people together and create unforgettable experiences.
Whether I'm working on a software project or whipping up a gourmet meal, I always strive to bring creativity and innovation to everything I do.
